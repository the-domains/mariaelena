We are Hugo and Maria, a husband and wife team based out of Downey CA, we specialize in natural light portraiture and life gatherings. 

Our photography business is more than just about camera equipment, its our personal art and hard work where we try to bring out the organic and real uniqueness of our clients. We definitely love working together as a team as Maria does all the artistic things while Hugo takes charge of some creative guide and the many other duties involved. So, we bring a balance with Maria's journalistic background for a timeless and beautiful look. Have a look for yourself through our site.
